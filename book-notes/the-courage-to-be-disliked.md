# The Courage To Be Disliked
## The first night
- teleology vs etiology - broadly: understanding the current state of things as a function of their explicit goal vs their casual reason for existing. It underpins most of the book. Life as it is can be looked at as an output of past events or as a direct outcome of a desired goal, whether we admit to that goal or not. 


## The second night
- All problems are interpersonal problems
- the feelings of inferiority are subjective interpretations rather than objective facts
    - This gives us a choice then in our state of feeling inferior
- The subjective interpretations are based on a value judgement which are themselves based on social context
- According to adler Humans fundamentally are in the constant pursuit of superiority. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It is the motivating factor that drives human progress. 
- We should separate the notion of a feeling of inferiority with a inferiority complex. The complex is an unconscious pattern of emotion and perceptions organised around a core theme, in this case, inferiority. It’s much more static. A state of fundamental. A feeling of inferiority can be motivating. It can be changed. 
- Convincing yourself off the causal connection between some fundamental state of being and a desired state is simply an excuse. We can always change.
    - But it takes courage to do so
- Adler says the state of feeling inferior is to heavy to stay in for along time
- So instead of changing, the harder thing to do, sometimes we end up with a superiority complex. We appeal to some established “superior” or power to mask on feelings of inferiority. E.g excessive wearing of jewellery with big gems, with allegiance to high status fashion. “Those that make themselves look bigger on borrowed power”. They’re living according to other’s value systems. They’re living other peoples lives. 
- the one that boasts only does so due to a feeling in inferiority. They have no confidence in themselves. An inverted feeling of inferiority. 
- By boasting about past misfortune, people can use it to create a sense of superiority. A feeling of being special. A way of controlling others. A way of making someone’s misfortune impenetrable and therefore make them uncontrollable. “You don’t understand how I feel”. “Use one’s misfortune in order to feel special”.
