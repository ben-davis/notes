A book who's ideas are much stronger than the story itself.

The metaverse, mind viruses, the corporate takeover of America - all amazing ideas with rich detail. But they're clearly the focus of the novel, with characters and plot designed to provide access to these ideas, rather than being the focus themselves.

The central character has very little development. He's always been an amazing programmer and sword fighter and that isn't challenged or threatened whatsoever. He has a romantic past with another character that turns out to be entirely inconsequential. He miraculously discovers a sinister plot without any real effort beyond an AI essentially telling him. He meets no resistant at all throughout the novel. Not with himself and not with anyone else. Even when explaining in inexplicably precise detail the nature of the conspiracy, his audience of the most powerful figures in the country give no pushback, no questioning, no challenge to his agenda. Everything comes far to easily and loses all intrigue because of it.

The other central character is a 15 year old girl who, although is the most interesting character and seems to have actual internal conflict, is routinely sexualized by many other characters. The book was written in 1992 which somehow was a year in which this is apparently acceptable. But she is in active control of her decisions and does develop somewhat over the course of the story, but not significantly.

But that's not to take away from the ideas which remain the most interesting part of the book. I just wish it didn't suffer from the same lack of attention to character that so many sci-fi novels do.
