# Project Hail Mary
This book reminded me why I like reading. Not out of obligation to your own self-identity (who routinely riddles you with guilt any time you don't complete the new thing), but for the shear joy of it. Project Hail Mary just reads so easily. No unnecessarily verbose sentences that obscure meaning behind "poetry", just effortless enjoyment. Not once did I find myself losing focus and realizing I hadn't been reading any of the words.

What I enjoyed the most was the positivity of it. Love of science spills out from every page. Alien encounters are so often the source of tension and drama within stories, but in PHM our main character finds friendship. A kindrid spirit who shares the love of solving problems and relishes the opportunity to learn. 

It may not win a Pulitzer, but PHM was a refreshing reminder of why I love stories: there's nothing quite like being lost in another world.
